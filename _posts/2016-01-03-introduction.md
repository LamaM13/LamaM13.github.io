*WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY)* has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As theyâ€™re new and inclusive organization, they try to do double duty with the gala both to fill their event space with people passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. To this end they place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to their gala.

*(WTWY)* wanted from us to analysed the MTA subway data, to help them optimize the placement of their street teams, such that they can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to their cause.
