*WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY)* has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As theyâ€™re new and inclusive organization, they try to do double duty with the gala both to fill their event space with people passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. To this end they place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to their gala.

*(WTWY)* wanted from us to analysed the MTA subway data, to help them optimize the placement of their street teams, such that they can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to their cause. 
Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
* [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
