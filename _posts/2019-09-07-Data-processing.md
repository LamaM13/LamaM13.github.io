Extract __top ten crowded__ stations and do the following:

* Top five crowded stations by <span style="text-decoration: underline">number of exits</span>
* Look for the most <span style="text-decoration: underline">crowded days</span>
* Look for the most <span style="text-decoration: underline">crowded times</span>
* Look for the most <span style="text-decoration: underline">crowded turnstiles</span>

Look for the stations near LAGUARDIA and JFK airports:
