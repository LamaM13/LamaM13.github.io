title: Predicting Hotels Rating Listed on Booking.com
---

### Overview 
*Booking.com* is a world leader in booking accommodations online. It acts as the intermediary between properties that want to sell their rooms and guests that are looking for accommodation.

### Case Study Problem 
In this problem, I want to find out the factors that influence the ratings of hotels or apartments listed on *booking.com* website, so as to be able to predict the future ratings of hotels or apartements by applying linear regression. To achieve this goal, I will specifically focus on the hotels and apartments listed in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Riyadh and Jeddah.
